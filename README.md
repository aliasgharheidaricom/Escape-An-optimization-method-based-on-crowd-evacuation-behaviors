# üöÄ Escape Algorithm (ESC)

**Escape Algorithm (ESC)** is a cutting-edge metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by the dynamic behavior of crowds during emergency evacuations. This innovative approach balances **exploration** and **exploitation** phases by mimicking the behaviors of calm, herding, and panic groups.

---

## üåü **Overview**

The ESC algorithm models crowd behaviors during evacuations:
- **Calm Group**: Rational agents methodically search for optimal solutions.
- **Herding Group**: Agents mimic others, focusing on promising regions.
- **Panic Group**: Erratic agents introduce randomness, ensuring diversity.

This behavioral simulation enables the ESC algorithm to efficiently navigate complex, high-dimensional search spaces, outperforming traditional optimization techniques.

## üìö **Abstract**

Meta-heuristic algorithms inspired by swarm intelligence are highly effective for solving black-box optimization problems but often struggle to balance exploration and exploitation. The ESC algorithm simulates crowd evacuation dynamics, dividing individuals into calm, herding, and panic groups:
- **Calm individuals** lead optimal paths with rational decision-making.
- **Herding individuals** enhance exploitation by following successful agents.
- **Panic individuals** introduce random diversity, preventing premature convergence.

### **Key Achievements:**
- **Benchmark Success**:
  - Ranked **1st** in 10D and 30D tests of **CEC 2017**.
  - Ranked **1st** in 10D and 20D tests of **CEC 2022**.
- **Real-World Applications**:
  - Engineering: Pressure vessel design, spring design.
  - Robotics: 3D UAV path planning.

The ESC algorithm‚Äôs dynamic behavioral modeling provides a robust framework for solving diverse optimization problems.

## ‚ú® **Algorithm Design**

### **1. Inspiration**
The ESC algorithm draws inspiration from human behavior during emergencies:
- **Leader-Follower Systems**: Leaders guide crowds, while followers emulate the majority.
- **Behavioral Dynamics**:
  - Calm agents rationally evaluate optimal paths.
  - Herding agents conform to group behavior.
  - Panic agents make unpredictable decisions, aiding exploration.

### **2. Phases of the Algorithm**
1. **Exploration Phase**:
   - Divides the population into calm, herding, and panic groups.
   - Adaptive movement strategies ensure diverse search coverage.
2. **Exploitation Phase**:
   - Refines solutions by converging towards the Elite Pool (top-performing solutions).

### **3. Key Mechanisms**
- **Panic Index**: Governs chaotic behavior, decreasing over time to focus on exploitation.
- **Elite Pool**: Maintains the best solutions, guiding agents towards optimal regions.
- **Levy Weights**: Adaptive step sizes modeled after natural processes, balancing exploration and exploitation.

## üèóÔ∏è **How ESC Works**

### **Initialization**
- The population is initialized randomly within the search space.
- An **Elite Pool** is created to track top-performing solutions.

### **Behavioral Groups**
- **Calm Group**: Updates positions towards the group center with slight randomness.
- **Herding Group**: Moves based on influences from both calm and panic groups.
- **Panic Group**: Explores erratically, inspired by top solutions and random directions.

### **Adaptive Transition**
- The **Panic Index** transitions the population from chaotic exploration to focused exploitation.
