# üöÄ Escape Algorithm (ESC)

**Escape Algorithm (ESC)** is a cutting-edge metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by the dynamic behavior of crowds during emergency evacuations. This innovative approach balances **exploration** and **exploitation** phases by mimicking the behaviors of calm, herding, and panic groups.

Abstract: Meta-heuristic algorithms, particularly those based on swarm intelligence, are highly effective for solving black-box optimization problems. However, maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation within these algorithms remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a useful algorithm, called Escape or Escape Algorithm (ESC), inspired by crowd evacuation behavior, to solve real-world cases and benchmark problems. The ESC algorithm simulates the behavior of crowds during the evacuation, where the population is divided into calm, herding, and panic groups during the exploration phase, reflecting different levels of decision-making and emotional states. Calm individuals guide the crowd toward safety, herding individuals imitate others in less secure areas, and panic individuals make volatile decisions in the most dangerous zones. As the algorithm transitions into the exploitation phase, the population converges toward optimal solutions, akin to finding the safest exit. The effectiveness of the ESC algorithm is validated on two adjustable problem size test suites, CEC 2017 and CEC 2022. ESC ranked first in the 10-dimensional, 30-dimensional tests of CEC 2017, and the 10-dimensional and 20-dimensional tests of CEC 2022, and second in the 50-dimensional and 100-dimensional tests of CEC 2017. Additionally, ESC performed exceptionally well, ranking first in the engineering problems of pressure vessel design, tension/compression spring design, and rolling element bearing design, as well as in two 3D UAV path planning problems, demonstrating its efficiency in solving real-world complex problems, particularly complex problems like 3D UAV path planning. Compared with 12 other high-performance, classical, and advanced algorithms, ESC exhibited superior performance in complex optimization problems.

## üåü **Overview**

The ESC algorithm models crowd behaviors during evacuations:
- **Calm Group**: Rational agents methodically search for optimal solutions.
- **Herding Group**: Agents mimic others, focusing on promising regions.
- **Panic Group**: Erratic agents introduce randomness, ensuring diversity.

This behavioral simulation enables the ESC algorithm to efficiently navigate complex, high-dimensional search spaces, outperforming traditional optimization techniques.

## üìö **Abstract**

Meta-heuristic algorithms inspired by swarm intelligence are highly effective for solving black-box optimization problems but often struggle to balance exploration and exploitation. The ESC algorithm simulates crowd evacuation dynamics, dividing individuals into calm, herding, and panic groups:
- **Calm individuals** lead optimal paths with rational decision-making.
- **Herding individuals** enhance exploitation by following successful agents.
- **Panic individuals** introduce random diversity, preventing premature convergence.

### **Key Achievements:**
- **Benchmark Success**:
  - Ranked **1st** in 10D and 30D tests of **CEC 2017**.
  - Ranked **1st** in 10D and 20D tests of **CEC 2022**.
- **Real-World Applications**:
  - Engineering: Pressure vessel design, spring design.
  - Robotics: 3D UAV path planning.

The ESC algorithm‚Äôs dynamic behavioral modeling provides a robust framework for solving diverse optimization problems.

## ‚ú® **Algorithm Design**

### **1. Inspiration**
The ESC algorithm draws inspiration from human behavior during emergencies:
- **Leader-Follower Systems**: Leaders guide crowds, while followers emulate the majority.
- **Behavioral Dynamics**:
  - Calm agents rationally evaluate optimal paths.
  - Herding agents conform to group behavior.
  - Panic agents make unpredictable decisions, aiding exploration.

### **2. Phases of the Algorithm**
1. **Exploration Phase**:
   - Divides the population into calm, herding, and panic groups.
   - Adaptive movement strategies ensure diverse search coverage.
2. **Exploitation Phase**:
   - Refines solutions by converging towards the Elite Pool (top-performing solutions).

### **3. Key Mechanisms**
- **Panic Index**: Governs chaotic behavior, decreasing over time to focus on exploitation.
- **Elite Pool**: Maintains the best solutions, guiding agents towards optimal regions.
- **Levy Weights**: Adaptive step sizes modeled after natural processes, balancing exploration and exploitation.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **How ESC Works**

### **Initialization**
- The population is initialized randomly within the search space.
- An **Elite Pool** is created to track top-performing solutions.

### **Behavioral Groups**
- **Calm Group**: Updates positions towards the group center with slight randomness.
- **Herding Group**: Moves based on influences from both calm and panic groups.
- **Panic Group**: Explores erratically, inspired by top solutions and random directions.

### **Adaptive Transition**
- The **Panic Index** transitions the population from chaotic exploration to focused exploitation.
